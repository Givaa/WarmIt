## Notes

- **Run from project root:** All scripts should be executed from the WarmIt project root directory
  ```bash
  cd /path/to/WarmIt
  ./scripts/force-rebuild.sh
  ```
- The main `start.sh` script is in the project root for convenience
- Scripts automatically detect their location and navigate to the correct directories
- These utility scripts are for advanced troubleshooting and maintenance
